# Genshin Vulkan Control
You can use the Magisk module or the .sh script to enable Genshin Vulkan for your device. Most other modules work incorrectly and do not store the device model number. Necessary tests have been done to make sure this module works.

## If You Are Using Module
After uninstalling the module, Vulkan is automatically disabled.

## If You Are Not Using Module
You can use MT Manager (bin.mt.plus) to run the .sh
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run it with root permission (su).

### ðŸš€ Best Performance
> [!TIP]
> You can use GPU Driver and if you have an old device, you can use MIUI Performance Saver
